# Database Creation


## Building the database

Load the packages necessary:
```{r packages, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(DBI)
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
library(patchwork)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggridges)
library(RSQLite)
```

## Establish a database connection

This will also create a new database

```{r establish connection, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
St.Vrain_db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "St.Vrain.db")
```

I now have a database called "St.Vrain.db" ready for tables and data.

## Retreiving the data

To begin creating this database, I first downloaded the [Riverscapes Context project](https://data.riverscapes.xyz/) for the St. Vrain Creek HUC level 8 (10190005). The NHD+ geodatabase is nested in here, but since I was already using it in ArcMap, it was easy for me to simply export the attribute table to excel. If I was doing this strictly following reproducible standards, I am sure there would be a way to code through all of those steps!

This attribute table contains the following headers:

1. FID
2. Permanent_
3. FDate
4. GNIS_ID
5. GNIS_Name
6. LengthKM
7. ReachCode
8. FlowDir
9. WBArea_Per
10. FType
11. FCode
12. MainPath
13. InNetwork
14. Visibility
15. Shape_Leng
16. NHDPlusID
17. VPUID
18. Enabled
19. AreasqKM
20. TotDAsqKm
21. Slope
22. MaxElevSmo
23. MinElevSmo
24. BFwidth

However, I am only interested in the following:

1. **FID** (reaches numbered from 0 to 10753)
2. **LengthKM** (the length of each reach in kilometers)
3. **InNetwork** (this tells me if the reach is in the actual stream network, or if it is a human made connector (i.e. a canal or gravel pond))
4. **TotDASqKm** (tells me the total drainage area of that reach in square kilometers)
5. **Slope** (slope of that reach)
6. **MaxElevSmo** (maximum elevation in feet of that reach)
7. **MinElevSmo** (minimum elevation in feet of that reach)
8. **BFwidth** (the average bankfull width of that reach)

There is code (that we talked about in class, I know!) that will allow me to load only the columns I want into my table. For this assignment, however, I mannually deleted the columns that I did not want in excel, and then saved as a CSV file. 

## Table creation

To create the table "reach_attributes"

```{r table creation, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
dbExecute(St.Vrain_db, "CREATE TABLE reach_attributes (
          FID float,
          LengthKM float,
          InNetwork float,
          TotDASqKm float,
          Slope float,
          MaxElevSmo float,
          MInElevSmo float,
          BFwidth float
          );")

```

## Loading the data

To load the data from the CSV into the table:

```{r data loading, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

reach_attributes <- read.csv("NHD_US_drainage.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

dbWriteTable(St.Vrain_db, "reach_attributes", reach_attributes, append = TRUE)

```

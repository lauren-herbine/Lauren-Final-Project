# Introduction
![St. Vrain Pic](St.VrainPic.jpg)

## Project Goals

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate some of the skills I have learned in "Computational Tools for Reproducible Science." I am using this opportunity to dig a little deeper into the NHD+ HR database and look at a watershed (the St. Vrain) that is within my study area- the Mississippi River Basin. This is by no means supposed to be rigorous analytical work.  


## Project Outline
This book is composed of the following additional chapters:
 
Chapter 2: Background

Chapter 3: Database creation

Chapter 4: Basin Morphometric visulizations 

Chapter 5: Analysis by EcoRegion

Chapter 6: Summary
